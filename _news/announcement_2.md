Thrilled to share that I’ve been selected for the highly competitive [Corporate Startup Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/swartz-center-for-entrepreneurship/education-and-resources/csl/index.html) (CSL) Fellowship, awarded to just 8-10 graduate students each semester by the Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship at Carnegie Mellon University. Through this fellowship, I’ll be collaborating with corporate clients on go-to-market strategies, new product development, and startup investments.

> I will be working under the leadership of [Jim Jen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimcjen/) (Director of CSL, Swartz ) and [Alessandro Oltramari](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/oltramari-alessandro.html) (President, Carnegie Bosch Institute)

I had an incredible experience collaborating with [Dr. Jonathan Francis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en), Senior Research Scientist at the Bosch Center for AI, alongside another CSL Fellow. Together, we mapped the robotics landscape across the U.S., with a particular focus on engaging with founders from Pittsburgh’s robotics startup scene. These companies spanned diverse sectors—from Defense and Construction to AgTech—and we had the opportunity to speak with entrepreneurs at every stage, from bootstrapped ARR startups to those who’ve raised billions in funding, to those who've got multi-million dollar exits.

Through these conversations, we gained valuable insights into the challenges these startups face and the types of partnerships they’re seeking within the broader ecosystem. Our work culminated in presenting a comprehensive thesis to Bosch, outlining strategic recommendations for new product development and actionable steps to strengthen partnerships and collaborations with these startups.

`Update: Feb 07, 2025`

I will be pausing my research under [Dr. Jonathan Franscis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7CLS0LwAAAAJ&hl=en) (Sr. Research Scientist, Bosch Research) and [Prof. Yonatan Bisk](https://talkingtorobots.com/yonatanbisk.html) (Assistant Professor, CMU) *for now. **I wish I had more time!!!***

During my winter break and this January, I explored methods on building object property representation by fusing multisensory data—audio, vision, touch, and proprioception—with a specific focus on leveraging contact-rich audio to enhance multimodal embeddings for contact-rich bi-manipulation tasks.

Some of the relevant works in the same directions:

1. [*Hearing Touch: Audio-Visual Pretraining for Contact-Rich Manipulation*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08576)
2. [*ManiWAV: Learning Robot Manipulation from In-the-Wild Audio-Visual Data*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19464)
3. [*MOSAIC: Learning Unified Multi-Sensory Object Property Representations for Robot Learning via Interactive Perception*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08508)
