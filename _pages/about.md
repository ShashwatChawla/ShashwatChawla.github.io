I'm a **second-year graduate** student at the [**Robotics Institute**](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD). My work focuses on developing GPS-denied[ wildfire monitoring solutions](https://theairlab.org/wildfire/) under the guidance of [Professor Sebastian Scherer](https://theairlab.org/team/sebastian/) and **learning-based multimodal odometry prediction** networks with [Professor Wenshan Wang](https://theairlab.org/team/wenshan/).

Prior to CMU, I was a **F****ounding Engineer** at [Peer Robotics](https://www.peerrobotics.ai/)[(Techstars W21)](https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/introducing-stanley-techstars-class-of-2021) for over 3 years, where I gained hands-on experience in building an **autonomous mobile robot from the ground up—taking it from a concept to CE certification and large-scale deployments**. I developed key autonomy modules—perception, SLAM, calibration, and simulation—while also engineering system-level scripts, automating testing workflows, and defining user requirements. I also led successful deployments at global Fortune 500 companies, driving substantial real-world impact.

In the summer of 2024, I interned at Walmart's Innovation Lab, working on perception and manipulation algorithms for autonomous trailer unloading and depalletizing operations. I also developed an item defect identification system using Vision-Language Models (VLMs), leading to a patent submission.

**I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities starting May 2025 in the following areas:**

1. `CLAMs - Calibration, Localization, and Mapping`
2. `Perception/Deep Learning Engineer`
3. `Robotics Software Engineer I/II`
